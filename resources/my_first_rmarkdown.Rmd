```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Let's set up!

First we want to load the tidyverse libraries and read in our plant datasets.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
plants <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-08-18/plants.csv')
```

## We are going to plot!

Here is a plot showing the number of plants on each continent!

```{r plantplot}
ggplot(plants) +
  # map columns onto plot features. some might calls these aesthetics
  aes(x = continent, fill = continent) + 
  geom_bar()
```
